<h1>The Basics</h1>

A Templar application consists of two things: data models and templates. Data models are
designed to contain only data - not functions. Data can be JavaScript primatives or objects.
They could even be functions but it's not considered best practice to store functions on
your data model.

<br/>

Templar data models are just plain JavaScript objects with a couple of built-in methods
designed to help you efficently modify and monitor your applications data.

<h4>Here's a data model</h4>
```
Templar.dataModel('Example',{
  aString : 'Hello World',
  numbers : [1,2,3],
  
  objects : [
      {text : 'uno', value : '1'},
      {text : 'dos', value : '2'},
      {text : 'tres', value : '3'}]
});
```

<br/>
Each property of a data model object is called a data model attribute (`DMA`).

<br/>

Templar's `DMA`s are designed to be bound into your application's templates. Template
are just plain-old HTML files. The HTML contained in your templates spring to life once you
bind Templar data models in them.

<br/>

Inside of a template, a data model acts as a variable. Whenever the value of that variable changes,
Templar will immediately update the output of that variable in your template. This is the time
and complexity saving aspect of Templar and other modern front-end frameworks.

<br/>

<h3>Using your data models in templates</h3>

To make use of `DMA`s in your template you use specially formatted variable called a nonterminal (`NT`).
It looks like this:
`{{Helper.aStringNT}}`

<br/>

<h4>Let's look at an example:</h4>

```
&lt;html&gt;
&lt;body&gt;
  <!-- Using the data model defined above, the un-compiled template looks like -->
  The value of Example.aString is:  {{Helper.aStringNT}}
&lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
```

Here's what it looks like to the end-user:

`The value of Example.aString is:  {{Example.aString}}`
<br/>
<br/>
Now change the value of Example.aString and watch Templar automatically update this page
to reflect the new value you type in:

<input value="{{Example.aString}}"/>

<h4>Hey, how'd you do that?! (2-way data binding)</h4>

Templar has what's called 2-way data binding. This means you can bind a `DMA` to DOM elements that 
get user input and the `DMA`s value will change instantly. Like this:

<br/><br/>
`<input value="{{Helper.aStringNT}}"/>`
<br/><br/>

Think of this as the inbound lane of a highway. Learn how to inbound  bind 
<a href="#/selects">selects</a> and 
<a href="#/selects">other inputs.</a>

<br/></br>

We can push data out to our template (ie, print `DMA` values to the screen) by sticking 
`{{Helper.aStringNT}}` in our markup (like we did above). This is out outbound lane.
Learn how to outbound  bind  <a href="#/repeats">lists and arrays.</a>
